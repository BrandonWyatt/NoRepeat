# NoRepeat

This project has a few requirements; it has been written using Python 2.7.14, and as such, will not run in Python 3. It may run in other versions of Python 2, but these are untested. The alert system is configured for a Windows computer, and is tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10. It is likely to work on Windows 8, or 8.1, as well, but will produce unknown output on other operating systems when a repeat song is discovered (most likely, crash)

The following packages may also be required to be installed:
  - pypiwin32
  - pywin32
  - urllib3
